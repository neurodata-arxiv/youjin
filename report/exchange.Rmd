## Theorem 2 

<a name = "Theorem2"/>
<b> $$\mbox{Theorem 2}$$  <center>  Assume $E| \boldsymbol{U}^2 | < \infty$   and $E | \boldsymbol{X}^2 | < \infty$. For a fixed $t$, $P[ \mathcal{T}_{n} < t ] \rightarrow P[t_{\nu - 1} < t]$ as $q,m \rightarrow \infty$

where $\mathcal{T}_{n} = \sqrt{\nu-1} \frac{\mathcal{R}^{*}_{n} }{ \sqrt{1 - \mathcal{R}^{* 2}_{n} }}$ and $\nu = \frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.

### Proof of Theorem 2

Throughout this paper, we assume that our observed network $\boldsymbol{G}$ is a randomly sampled network from its population, infinite graph $\mathcal{G}$ of which we observe a finite subgraph. 

Note that for fixed diffusion time $t > 0,$ diffusion distance $\mathbf{U}_{t} =  \{\mathbf{U}_{t}(1), \mathbf{U}_{t}(2), ... , \mathbf{U}_{t}(n) \}$ are constructed from an adjacency matrix $A_{ij}$, and it is represented by eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and stationary distribution of a given network. 

Under the assumption that $\boldsymbol{G}$ is an exchangeable graph, its symmetric kernel $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is also exchangeable. :

$\boldsymbol{Q}[\sigma(i), \sigma(j)] := \sqrt{\pi \big( \sigma(i) \big) / \pi \big( \sigma(j) \big) } P[\sigma(i), \sigma(j)] =  \big\{ A_{\sigma(i), \sigma(j)} \big/ \sqrt{ \mathbf{A}_{\sigma(i) \cdot }   \mathbf{A}_{\sigma(j) \cdot} } \big\} \big\{ \sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{n} A_{ \sigma(i), \sigma(j)} \big\}^{-1}  =  \big\{ A_{\sigma(i), \sigma(j)} \big/  \sqrt{ \mathbf{A}_{\sigma(i) \cdot }   \mathbf{A}_{\sigma(j) \cdot} }  \big\}  \big\{ \sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{n} A_{ij} \big\}^{-1}$

where $\mathbf{A}_{\sigma(i) \cdot} = \sum\limits_{\sigma(j) = 1}^{n} A_{\sigma(i) \sigma(j)} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} A_{\sigma(i) j}$ 

Note that $\sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{n} \mathbf{A}_{ij} : =  c$ is invariant to permutation. 

Thus ~





Then under the provided assumptions, ``MCorr`` defined on these pairs of observations, $\mathcal{R}^{*}_{n}$ are measuring distance between the joint characteristic function $f_{UX}$ of $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ and the the product $f_{U}$ $f_{X}$ of the marginal characteristic functions for each $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ ([Szekely and Rizzo, 2013](Szekely2)). The desired asymptotic properties are well proven for exchangeable observations.  $\blacksquare$ 


## Exchangeability
<a names="exchangeability"/>

Formally speaking, an exchangeable sequence of random variables is a finite or infinite sequence $U_{1}, U_{2}, ...$ of random variables such that for any inite permutation $\sigma$ of the indices 1,2,3, ... , the joint probability distribution of the permutated sequence 
$U_{\sigma(1)}, U_{\sigma(2)}, U_{\sigma(3)}, ...$
is the same as the joint probability distribution of the original sequence. 

The propoerty of exchangeability is closely related to the use of independent and identically-distributed(i.i.d) random variable. A sequence of random variables that are i.i.d. conditional on some underlying distributional form is exchangeable. Moreover, the converse can be established for ``infinite sequence`` by [Bruno de Finetti](#Finetti). The extended versions of the theorem show that in any infinite sequence of exchangeable random variables, the random variables are conditionally i.i.d, given the underlying distributional form.  

It is straightforward to check that $\mathbf{G}$ is an exchangeable graph if and only if its adjacency matix $\mathbf{A}$ is jointly exchangeble.  

A random 2-array $(A_{ij})$ is called $\mathbf{\mbox{jointly exchangeable}}$ if 
$$(A_{ij}) \stackrel{d}{=} (A_{\sigma(i) \sigma(j)})$$
for every permutation $\sigma$ of $n$,
and separately exchangeable if 
$$(A_{ij}) \stackrel{d}{=} (A_{\sigma(i) \sigma^{\prime}(j) })$$
for every pair of permutation $\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}$ of $n$.

$\mathbf{\mbox{Joint exchangeability}}$ of $A$ is what we need. 

The analogue of de Finetti's theorem for exchangeable arrays is the ``Aldous-Hoover Theorem``. A random array $(A_{ij})$ is jointly exchangeable if and only if it can be represented as follows : There is a random function $F : [0,1]^2 \rightarrow \mathbf{A}$ such that

$$(A_{ij}) \stackrel{d}{=} \big( F( W_{i}, W_{j}, W_{i,j} )\big)$$

where $(W_{i})_{i = 1,2,... , n}$ and $(W_{i,j})_{i,j=1,2,.,,n}$ are, respectively, a sequence and an array of i.i.d. Uniform[0,1] random variables, which are independent of $F$. 

$$A[i,j] := \mathbb{P} \big[  F(W_{i},W_{j}, W_{ij}) = 1  \big| F \big]$$

The distribution of any exchangeable graph is characterized by a distribution on the space of functions $A$ from $[0,1]^2$ to [0,1]. 
It was proven that $\mathbf{G}$ is an exchangeable if and only if there exists a random function $f$ from $[0,1]^2$ to [0,1] such that 

$$(A_{ij}) \stackrel{d}{=} \big( \mathbb{1}\{ W_{i,j} < f(W_{i}, W_{j})   \}   \big)$$.


This representation yields the following generative process : 

(1) Sample a random function $f \sim \mathcal{f}$.

(2) For every vertex $i \in \{1,2, .. , n\}$, sample an indepenent uniform random variable $W_{i}$, independently also from $f$.

(3) For every pair of vertices $i < j \in \{1,2, ... , n\}$, sample

$$A_{ij} | f, W_{i}, W_{i} \sim Bernoulli \big( f(W_{i}, W_{j} ) \big)$$

where $A_{ij} = 1$ indicates the edge connecting $i$ and $j$ is present; if $A_{ij} = 0$, it is absent.
